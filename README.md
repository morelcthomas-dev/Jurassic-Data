# 🦖 jurassic Data — Power BI Project

## 🌍 Project Description

**jurassic Data** is an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that allows the comparison of more than **300 different dinosaur species**.  
Through its visualizations, the dashboard explores the geographical locations where dinosaurs lived, their diet distribution, average sizes, and discovery history.  

The dataset is sourced from the **Natural History Museum**, representing approximately **30% of currently known dinosaur species**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Identify the **geographical areas** inhabited by dinosaurs  
- Understand the **distribution of species** based on their diet  
- Compare dinosaurs by **average size** and **species type**  
- Visualize **when** and **by whom** dinosaur fossils were discovered

## 📊 Dashboard Visualizations

### 1 – 🦖 Where did dinosaurs live? 🌍

**Goal:** Display the geographical distribution of discovered fossils by dinosaur diet.  

**Visualizations included:**
- 🗺️ **World map** of discovered fossils, categorized by diet (carnivorous, herbivorous, omnivorous, etc.)  
- 🧭 **Filters** for geological periods (Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous) and diet type  

👉 **Key Insight:** Fossils are most frequently discovered in North America, Europe, and Asia, highlighting both the paleontological focus and historical habitat zones of dinosaurs.

### 2 – 🍃 What did dinosaurs eat? 🍖

**Goal:** Analyze the diversity of dinosaur diets and species composition.  

**Visualizations included:**
- 📊 **Bar chart:** Count of dinosaurs by diet  
- 📊 **Bar chart:** Average dinosaur length (in meters) by diet  
- 🥬 **Pie chart:** Percentage distribution of dietary groups (Herbivorous: 60%, Carnivorous: 30%, Omnivorous: 8%)  
- 🦕 **Filters:** By dinosaur type (Sauropod, Ceratopsian, Theropod, etc.) and geological period  

👉 **Key Insight:** Most dinosaurs were herbivores, indicating a strong dependence on rich vegetation ecosystems. Carnivorous species represent about one-third of the total sample.

### 3 – 🦕 How tall are dinosaurs? 📏

**Goal:** Compare the average sizes of dinosaurs and their distribution by species and time period.  

**Visualizations included:**
- 📋 **Matrix:** Dinosaur name, species, and geological period  
- ⚪ **Bar chart:** Average length (in meters) by dinosaur type  
- 📏 **KPI indicators:**  
  - Average dinosaur length: **7.16 m**  
  - Average year of discovery: **1955**  
- 🧭 **Filters:** By diet and geological period  

👉 **Key Insight:** Sauropods and large theropods dominate in terms of size, often exceeding 15 meters, while small ornithischians and theropods average below 5 meters.

### 4 – ⛏️⛏️ When were dinosaurs discovered? 🦴

**Goal:** Visualize the timeline of fossil discoveries and the paleontologists behind them.  

**Visualizations included:**
- 📈 **Line chart:** Count of dinosaur discoveries by year  
- 📊 **Bar chart:** Number of fossils discovered per paleontologist (notably Marsh, Brown, Lambe, Bonaparte, and Osborn)  
- 🌋 **Bar chart:** Number of species discovered by geological period (peaking in the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous)  

👉 **Key Insight:** Most major discoveries occurred between the **19th and 20th centuries**, with paleontologists like **Othniel C. Marsh** and **Henry F. Osborn** playing key roles in identifying iconic dinosaur species.
